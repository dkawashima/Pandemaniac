'''
This program uses sim.py and runs strategies against one another.
Gives us an idea of how different strategies play against
each other.
'''

'''
===========
   USAGE        for sim.py
===========

>>> import sim
>>> sim.run([graph], [dict with keys as names and values as a list of nodes])

Returns a dictionary containing the names and the number of nodes they got.

Example:
>>> graph = {"2": ["6", "3", "7", "2"], "3": ["2", "7, "12"], ... }
>>> nodes = {"strategy1": ["1", "5"], "strategy2": ["5", "23"], ... }
>>> sim.run(graph, nodes)
>>> {"strategy1": 243, "strategy6": 121, "strategy2": 13}

Possible Errors:
- KeyError: Will occur if any seed nodes are invalid (i.e. do not exist on the
            graph).
